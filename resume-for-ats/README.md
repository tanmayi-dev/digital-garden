# Optimize Resume for Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

Software that allows companies to efficiently manage and track candidates.

### Increasing Match Strength

1. Keywords
2. Title
   - Same/similar titles and progressing titles
   - Your company may call some role differently, you can change it to match job description as long as its honest to do so
3. Degree
4. Resume Structure
   - fonts, graphics, photos, etc

### Keywords
 - Relevant keywords maximize your odds that both the software and recruiter will see you as strong fit.
 - Exercise :
   - Print a copy of Job Description
   - Use 3 highlighters
       1. Identify Hard Skills (e.g., technical skills)
       2. Identify Soft Skills (e.g., curiosity, cross functional collaboration)
       3. Action Verbs (e.g., collaborate, grow, lead, develop)
   - Find someone with same job in the company you are applying on linkedin, and see what they have written and weave it in your resume

### Other Criteria

70% - 75% are screened out through ATS

1. Job Title
   - Try to match the Job Title in the Job Description
   - For example, Marketing Manager, but your company calls it Content Manager, if its honest to do so, then change it
   
2. Certificates and Licenses
   - If a certificate is listed as acronym e.g., Project Management Professional and job description lists it as PMP, then make use PMP.  This will be detected by scanning software.

3. Educational Requirements
   - If there are any gray areas, be sure to try to get your resume into human hands.
   - ATS are black or white.

## Formatting

1. Tables and Columns

   - Key skills can be in 2-3 column format
   - Do not set resume in multiple column format
    
2. Headers and Footers 
   - Do not put contact information in header
   - You can center align the name and contact information on the page, at top, make it bold but keep it in regular content section
   - Do not embed critical information in header
   
3. Complicated Section Titles
   - Do's
     - Summary
     - Key Skills
     - Professional Experience 
   - Dont's
     - Who I am ?
     - What I know ?
     - Where I worked ?

## Fonts

- Use standard PC fonts - serif or sans-serif
- Serif Fonts
  - Often associated with mature or conservative audiences
  - Times New Roman and Garamond
- Sans Serif Fonts
  - Often associated with modern or comtemporary audiences
  - Arial, Calibri and Verdana
- Maintain consistency
- Like Section Header in Serfi and Body in Sans Serif

## Graphics, Logos and Photos

- If you plan to use any graphics on an ATS resume, remove them
- They don't work with ATS

## Types of Resume for the ATS

1. Reverse Chronological Resume
   - Includes employment history, beginning with the most recent job and then going backwards

2. Functional Resume
   - Focusses on key accomplishments, skills and abilities
   - Lists all these at top of resume and then mentions jobs at the end

3. Hybrid Resume
   - Highlights skills and accomplishments first, followed by work experience in chronological order
   - Skills and experiences - your value proposition in the beginning
   - Reverse chronological format later

**Hybrid Resume is best for ATS and Humans as well**

2. Contact Details and Current Job Title
3. Professional Summary
4. Core Competencies / Key Skills
5. Work Experience / Professional Experience
